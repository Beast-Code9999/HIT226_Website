Project Breif:

Cooking websites should present a variety of visually appealing Asian culinary recipes to make users eager to explore different backgrounds quickly to suit thier tastes. A unique, interesting design with simplistic and readable visual cards for recipes would be desirable.

Hypothesis: Getting qualitative and quantitative feedback from users is the way to identify improvements to the website and data analysis can be used to determine if user behaviour or website performance has changed.
